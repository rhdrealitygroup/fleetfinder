# BUG REGISTRY — LotCompass / FleetFinder

**This is the permanent, append-only ledger of every bug ever found and fixed in this app.** It is shared across all agents and sessions.

## Protocol (every agent MUST follow)
1. **READ this entire file before auditing or fixing anything.** Every entry is a known failure mode — its **Pattern** field tells you where the same class of bug can re-hide. Hunt those places.
2. **Append a new `BUG-NNNN` entry the moment you confirm a new bug** (don't wait for the end). Fill fix/commit/evidence when resolved.
3. **Append-only.** Never edit or delete a prior entry except to update its own Status/Fix/Evidence. Never renumber. IDs are permanent and increasing.
4. On a merge conflict here, **keep both sides** (union) — never drop an entry.
5. This is the canonical ledger; `AUDIT_FINDINGS.md` is a per-run working log. Keep them consistent.

## The recurring patterns (memorize these — most bugs are a new face of one of them)
- **P1 — Provider-value vocabulary mismatch:** any value sent to MarketCheck/Auto.dev (filter label, trim, color, feature, drivetrain, body type, powertrain) must equal a REAL live facet value, or it silently matches nothing → 0 results. Verify every value against the live facet.
- **P2 — Count ≠ availability:** some endpoints return a `num_found` but no `listings` under our entitlement (e.g. `/search/car/active?dealer_id=`). A non-zero count is not data.
- **P3 — Plan/tier limits, undocumented:** real caps (pagination offset 1500, rows 50) differ from the generic docs. Verify limits live with our key.
- **P4 — Unwired/ineffective cache:** in-memory caches don't survive serverless cold starts; DB cache tables can exist but be unconnected. "Cached" in code ≠ cached in prod.
- **P5 — Sparse-column filtering:** filtering on a partially-populated column silently excludes the un-populated majority.
- **P6 — Recompute faster than data changes:** expensive cron work on a cadence faster than the underlying data actually changes.
- **P7 — Producer with no consumer:** a table/pipeline written but read by nothing (spends quota/compute). (Exception: the `inventory`/dump pipeline is intentionally kept for future auto-desking.)
- **P8 — Raw provider junk stored / un-sanitized into params:** factory-code cruft, typos, comma/bracket/slash tokens that break comma-OR filters downstream.
- **P9 — Stale client state:** `router.refresh()` doesn't reset `useState`; server-prop changes must be re-synced into client state.
- **P10 — Unbounded math / missing edge handling:** financial/range math not clamped (negatives, zero, missing MSRP); assumed JSON field paths.
- **P11 — Identifier mismatch across systems:** our DB strings/ids differ from the provider's (model names, dealer ids, make casing).
- **P12 — PostgREST quirks:** untagged arrays are `'{}'` not NULL; `.or()` interpolation is injection-prone; array-contains needs `cs.{"value"}`.

## Entries

### BUG-0001 — Search returned only the first 10 results
- **Date:** 2026-06-18  **Severity:** High  **Found by:** owner report → agent
- **Area:** `live-search` / `lib/marketcheck.ts` (PAGE_SIZE)
- **Symptom:** every search showed ~10 results regardless of inventory.
- **Root cause:** `PAGE_SIZE=100` but MarketCheck's max `rows`/request is 50; over-asking made the API silently return its DEFAULT of 10, then the paging loop broke (`10 < 100`).
- **Pattern (P3):** an API silently ignores an out-of-range param and substitutes a default — verify every `rows`/`limit`/`start`/facet-size range against the live API.
- **Fix:** `PAGE_SIZE=50`, `SEARCH_LIMIT=150` (3 pages), both provider loops. Commits: fleetfinder-v2 `f7d5490`, fleetfinder `72ad764`.
- **Evidence:** live search returned 150 results after fix (was 10).
- **Status:** Fixed & verified live.

### BUG-0002 — Dealer-scoped search returned 0 results
- **Date:** 2026-06-20  **Severity:** Critical  **Found by:** owner report → agent
- **Area:** `live-search` dealer path
- **Symptom:** selecting dealers and searching returned `total>0` but 0 results.
- **Root cause:** `/search/car/active?dealer_id=` returns a `num_found` COUNT but NO `listings` under our entitlement. (A first fix attempt using `source=domain` ALSO returned count-only — same root cause.) The data only comes from `/dealerships/inventory` (Dealership Inventory Syndication, $1/call), which accepts a comma-OR `dealer_id` list.
- **Pattern (P2):** count ≠ availability; wrong endpoint for the data shape. Hunt anywhere `.listings` is read after a filtered call.
- **Fix:** dealer-scoped searches route to `/dealerships/inventory` with comma-OR `dealer_id`; guard for no-valid-ids; geo skipped. Commits: fleetfinder-v2 `3610dcc`, fleetfinder `d1eba8d`.
- **Evidence:** live: single dealer → 150 results all from that dealer; multi-dealer merges sources; `/search/car/active?dealer_id=…` proven count-only (num_found 193, listings 0).
- **Status:** Fixed & verified live.

### BUG-0003 — Dealer directory truncated at the 1500 offset cap
- **Date:** 2026-06-20  **Severity:** High  **Found by:** owner report ("NY/NJ dealers missing") → agent
- **Area:** `sync-dealers` cron
- **Symptom:** dense states' dealer lists were short (NY independent stored 1500 of 1906; CA/TX/FL likewise).
- **Root cause:** MarketCheck Standard-tier caps pagination at `start` offset 1500 (`422 "Subscribed package pagination limit of 1500 rows exceeded"`). The generic docs said 10,000/rows; our plan's real cap is 1500.
- **Pattern (P3):** plan-specific limits. Hunt every paging loop for silent tail-drop.
- **Fix:** sub-partition a saturated state+type slice by city (each city < cap), resumable across runs via new `dealer_sync_state.city_cursor`. Migration `0031`. Commit: fleetfinder-v2 `3610dcc`.
- **Evidence:** live 422 at start=1500 confirmed; city facet + city-filtered pulls verified to reach the tail.
- **Status:** Fixed & verified.

### BUG-0004 — Filter values returned 0 (drivetrain/body_type vocabulary mismatch)
- **Date:** 2026-06-21  **Severity:** High  **Found by:** owner report ("no matches") → agent
- **Area:** `live-search` + `diagnose` (body_type, drivetrain)
- **Symptom:** picking "AWD", "Truck", or "Van" returned 0 results on every search.
- **Root cause:** MarketCheck's facet vocabulary differs from UI labels: `drivetrain` = `4WD|FWD|RWD` (no "AWD"; AWD is bucketed `4WD`); `body_type` = `Pickup`/`Cargo Van`/`Minivan`/`Passenger Van`/… (no "Truck"/"Van"). Verified live: `drivetrain=AWD` → 0 vs `4WD` → 2.28M; `body_type=Truck` → 0 vs `Pickup` → 760K.
- **Pattern (P1):** every UI/catalog value sent to a provider must equal a real facet value. Hunt EVERY filter value the UI can emit.
- **Fix:** `mcDrivetrain`/`mcBodyType` mappers (AWD→4WD, Truck→Pickup, Van→Cargo Van,Minivan,Passenger Van); UI collapsed to one "AWD/4WD" option; dead `FUEL_TYPES`/`EV_FUELS` removed. Commits: fleetfinder-v2 `2304126`, fleetfinder `c8594da`.
- **Evidence:** live after deploy: AWD/4WD → 192,989; Truck → 760,205; Van → 117,216.
- **Status:** Fixed & verified live.

### BUG-0005 — Make filter hid ~80% of dealers
- **Date:** 2026-06-21  **Severity:** High  **Found by:** owner report ("NJ list incomplete") → agent
- **Area:** `dealers/catalog` picker
- **Symptom:** picking a make showed a tiny fraction of dealers (NJ + Honda → 19 of ~1700).
- **Root cause:** filter used strict `makes @> {make}`, but ~80% of dealers had empty `makes` tags (`'{}'`, not NULL) → all untagged dealers excluded.
- **Pattern (P5/P12):** sparse-column filtering excludes the un-populated majority; untagged arrays are `'{}'` not NULL.
- **Fix:** include untagged-but-stocked dealers alongside tagged matches; backfilled NY/NJ makes (2,870 dealers, opt-in `?backfill_makes`) so those states are precise while others keep the inclusive safety net. Commits: fleetfinder-v2 `2304126`,`44cd550`,`eef7996`.
- **Evidence:** live: NJ Honda 19→1707 (inclusive) → 38 (precise after backfill); CA Honda 1960 (still inclusive, no regression).
- **Status:** Fixed & verified live.

### BUG-0006 — VIN-decode cache never wired to the DB (the MarketCheck bill driver)
- **Date:** 2026-06-21  **Severity:** Critical (cost)  **Found by:** owner ($2,177 invoice) → agent
- **Area:** `lib/marketcheck.ts` decode functions; `vin_decode_cache` table
- **Symptom:** NeoVIN decodes = 17,594 × $0.08 = $1,407 in 20 days.
- **Root cause:** decodes were "cached" only in `memoryCache` (per-isolate, in-memory). On Vercel serverless, cold starts + parallel isolates meant the same VINs were re-decoded and re-charged. The DB cache tables (`vin_decode_cache`/`trim_cache`/`color_cache`/`search_cache`) existed but were wired to nothing.
- **Pattern (P4):** in-memory cache doesn't survive cold starts; schema landed but code never connected.
- **Fix:** durable DB cache under the memory cache (memory→DB→live), shared by the names+details paths (one decode per VIN, ever). Commits: fleetfinder-v2 `82d1375`, fleetfinder `dffbbb2`.
- **Evidence:** live: `vin_decode_cache` 0→150 rows on a search; second identical search reused cache (2,254ms vs 5,418ms, only new VINs added).
- **Status:** Fixed & verified live. NOTE: `trim_cache`/`color_cache`/`search_cache` are STILL unused — candidates for the optimization pass.

### BUG-0007 — Nightly catalog option-decode on churning inventory
- **Date:** 2026-06-21  **Severity:** High (cost)  **Found by:** agent (during cost diagnosis)
- **Area:** `refresh-catalog` / `catalogSnapshot`
- **Symptom:** ~2,352 NeoVIN decodes/night just to rebuild the options catalog, on fresh inventory the cache couldn't help.
- **Root cause:** the snapshot re-decoded 6 sampled VINs per model every night; available options barely change.
- **Pattern (P6):** recompute faster than the data changes.
- **Fix:** only re-decode a model's options when missing or stale; throttled to once a week (`skipOptions` + `OPTIONS_TTL_MS`). Commits: fleetfinder-v2 `82d1375`,`8b4d108`.
- **Evidence:** code path verified; options row preserved on skip/budget-cut.
- **Status:** Fixed. (Optimization pass: consider event/model-year-gated instead of weekly.)

### BUG-0008 — On-select dealer dump spent quota writing nothing
- **Date:** 2026-06-21  **Severity:** Low (cost)  **Found by:** agent
- **Area:** `dealers/selection` POST `after()` hook
- **Symptom:** adding a dealer fired `dumpDealerListings` which pages `/search/car/active?dealer_id=` (count-only) → wrote nothing into the unread, cron-paused `inventory` table.
- **Pattern (P2/P7):** count-only endpoint; producer with no live consumer.
- **Fix:** paused the on-select dump (kept dealer registration in `tracked_dealers`); restore via `/dealerships/inventory` when auto-desking ships. Commit: fleetfinder-v2 `b17c26d`.
- **Evidence:** code path; matches the already-paused `dump-inventory` cron.
- **Status:** Fixed. (Pipeline intentionally KEPT for auto-desking — do not remove.) **UPDATE 2026-06-21: SUPERSEDED by BUG-0019 — owner decided to delete the dump pipeline; the "keep for auto-desking" note and the P7 exception no longer apply.**

### BUG-0009 — Comma-bearing color facet values mis-filter (S4)
- **Date:** 2026-06-21  **Severity:** Med  **Found by:** audit loop
- **Area:** pickers (color facets)
- **Symptom:** color values containing commas broke the comma-OR `exterior_color` filter.
- **Pattern (P8):** raw provider strings with delimiters break downstream comma-OR params.
- **Fix:** drop/scrub comma-bearing color facet values. Commit: fleetfinder-v2 `ffdbd12`.
- **Status:** Fixed (per audit loop).

### BUG-0010 — Diagnose made a guaranteed-null closest-match call for dealer-scoped searches (D1)
- **Date:** 2026-06-21  **Severity:** Low (cost)  **Found by:** audit loop
- **Area:** `diagnose`
- **Root cause:** the closest-match query used `/search/car/active` with `dealer_id` (count-only) → always empty, while still spending a call.
- **Pattern (P2):** count-only endpoint where listings are needed.
- **Fix:** skip the closest-match query when dealer-scoped (facet-derived reasons still render). Commits: fleetfinder-v2 `109f346`, fleetfinder mirror.
- **Evidence:** live: `/search/car/active?dealer_id=…&make=…` count matches syndication count (129), listings 0.
- **Status:** Fixed (per audit loop).

### BUG-0011 — Lease payment could go negative (L1)
- **Date:** 2026-06-21  **Severity:** Med  **Found by:** audit loop
- **Area:** lease calculator
- **Root cause:** depreciation unbounded → negative monthly payment for edge inputs.
- **Pattern (P10):** financial math not clamped against edge inputs.
- **Fix:** clamp depreciation at 0. Commit: fleetfinder-v2 `fac5180`.
- **Status:** Fixed (per audit loop). (Optimization/audit pass: review ALL lease terms — residual>MSRP, money-factor signs, $0 price, used cars.)

### BUG-0012 — Admin price map stale after refresh (U1)
- **Date:** 2026-06-21  **Severity:** Low  **Found by:** audit loop
- **Area:** admin CompaniesTable
- **Root cause:** `router.refresh()` doesn't reset client `useState`; the price map wasn't re-synced from props.
- **Pattern (P9):** server-prop changes not re-synced into client state.
- **Fix:** re-sync from props after refresh. Commit: fleetfinder-v2 `6f5b0a6`.
- **Status:** Fixed (per audit loop). (Hunt P9 in every client component seeding useState from props.)

### BUG-0013 — Feature chips sent labels MarketCheck doesn't index (F1)
- **Date:** 2026-06-21  **Severity:** High  **Found by:** audit loop (in-flight)
- **Area:** feature picker (`FEATURE_GROUPS`) → `high_value_features`
- **Root cause:** feature `value`s were UI labels (e.g. "sunroof", "navigation system") not real facet strings ("sun/moonroof", "navigation") → 0 results.
- **Pattern (P1):** provider-value vocabulary mismatch (high_value_features facet).
- **Fix:** map every feature chip to a verified live facet value; omit features MarketCheck can't filter. Commits: fleetfinder-v2 `38e176c`, fleetfinder `8de45f0`.
- **Evidence (live on www.lotcompass.com after deploy):** `features:["sun/moonroof"]` → **106,163** results; the old `features:["sunroof"]` → **0** (bug reproduced + fix proven on the deployed app). Live facet probe: `sun/moonroof`→1,482,013 vs `sunroof`→0.
- **Status:** Fixed & verified live (merged to main, deployed). Another instance of P1 — confirms the pattern is broad.

### BUG-0014 — Trim filter didn't round-trip (F2)
- **Date:** 2026-06-21  **Severity:** Med  **Found by:** audit loop (in-flight)
- **Area:** `list-trims` / trim filter
- **Root cause:** the trim string wasn't sent to MarketCheck in the raw form that round-trips through its trim filter.
- **Pattern (P1/P11):** provider value/identifier mismatch (trim strings).
- **Fix:** send the raw MarketCheck trim string (what the catalog path already did). Commits: fleetfinder-v2 `35352fd`, fleetfinder `f367afc`.
- **Evidence (live on www.lotcompass.com after deploy):** Mercedes-Benz GLE `trim:"GLE350"` → **11,803** results (was unfilterable as the space-inserted "GLE 350"). Live facet probe: `trim=GLE350`→40 vs `trim=GLE 350`→0 (space-sensitive).
- **Status:** Fixed & verified live (merged to main, deployed).

### BUG-0015 — Catalog stored raw factory-code color/version junk
- **Date:** 2026-06-20  **Severity:** Med  **Found by:** agent
- **Area:** `catalogSnapshot` / pickers
- **Symptom:** colors like "0475 Black Sapphire Metallic", "Nh-731p", "Blk"; version typo "Stamdard Range".
- **Pattern (P8):** raw provider data persisted without cleaning, surfaces in pickers.
- **Fix:** `cleanColorFacet` + `scrubColorCode` + `fixVersionName` applied at snapshot write time; SQL cleanup of existing rows. Commits: fleetfinder-v2 `7e7a7321`,`a78d8f1`,`591f7fb`.
- **Status:** Fixed.

### BUG-0016 — refresh-catalog self-chain stalled (~258/392 models)
- **Date:** 2026-06-19  **Severity:** Med  **Found by:** agent
- **Area:** `refresh-catalog` cron
- **Root cause:** models returning null never advanced `catalog_sync_state`; since never-seen sort first, they were re-attempted every chained link, burning budget before the cycle finished.
- **Pattern:** self-chaining cron must mark every model attempted-even-on-null or it loops.
- **Fix:** stamp every attempted model regardless of outcome; raise MAX_LINKS. Commit: fleetfinder-v2 `1c07bc8`.
- **Status:** Fixed.

### BUG-0017 — Catalog snapshot sampled 10 listings instead of 150 (rows>50 → API default 10)
- **Date:** 2026-06-21  **Severity:** Med  **Found by:** audit loop (Pass 7)
- **Area:** `lib/catalogSnapshot.ts` (the trim→color sampler; run nightly by `refresh-catalog`, feeds the trims/colors pickers)
- **Symptom:** each model's per-trim exterior/interior color lists were built from a tiny sample, so trims showed too few colors.
- **Root cause:** the sampler used `ROWS=100`. MarketCheck's `/search/car/active` silently ignores a `rows` above 50 and returns its DEFAULT of 10; the loop then broke (`10 < 100`), so only 10 cars per model were sampled instead of the intended 150 (`PAGES=3 × 100`).
- **Pattern (P3):** same class as BUG-0001 — an out-of-range param is silently replaced by a default. Hunt EVERY `rows`/`limit` > 50 against `/search/car/active`.
- **Fix:** `ROWS=50` (the real per-page max) → 3×50 = 150 samples, offset within the 1500 cap. Commit: fleetfinder-v2 `a25e942` (LotCompass only — FleetFinder has no nightly catalog system). Re-verify after merge/deploy.
- **Evidence:** live: `rows=10`→10 listings, `rows=50`→50, `rows=100`→**10** (Toyota RAV4, `/search/car/active`) — confirms >50 silently defaults to 10. Commit `a25e942` deployed; the per-trim color lists repopulate with the fuller 150-car sample on the next nightly `refresh-catalog` run.
- **Status:** Fixed — merged to main, deployed.

### BUG-0018 — Stripe webhook seat true-up had no idempotency key
- **Date:** 2026-06-21  **Severity:** Low  **Found by:** audit (independent billing/auth review)
- **Area:** `stripe/webhook` trial→active seat reconciliation
- **Symptom:** none observed in practice — the gap is an invariant violation, not a live defect.
- **Root cause:** the two `stripe.subscriptions.update(...)` true-up calls carried no `idempotencyKey`. They are idempotent-by-value (absolute quantity, `proration_behavior:"none"`, guarded by `desired !== currentQty`), so no double-billing was possible — but a redelivered `subscription.updated` event could fire a redundant update, violating the app's "every sub mutation uses an idempotency key" rule.
- **Pattern:** money-path idempotency invariant; any Stripe write must carry a stable key so retries are no-ops.
- **Fix:** added `idempotencyKey: seat-trueup-${sub.id}-${desired}` to both calls. Commit: fleetfinder-v2 `a25e942` (LotCompass only — FleetFinder billing is a separate Base44 `manage_billing`).
- **Evidence:** code review + invariant; quantity is absolute so no over-billing was ever possible. Rest of billing/auth (checkout/cancel/referrals/gate/RLS/`/api`-JSON) reviewed and upheld. Commit `a25e942` deployed.
- **Status:** Fixed — merged to main, deployed.

### BUG-0019 — Inventory dump read the count-only dealer endpoint → captured nothing; pipeline removed
- **Date:** 2026-06-21  **Severity:** Med (latent)  **Found by:** audit loop (Pass 7) + owner decision
- **Area:** `lib/inventoryDump.ts`, `cron/dump-inventory`, the `inventory` table
- **Symptom:** the dump mirrored 0 cars per dealer (and the table was read by nothing anyway).
- **Root cause:** the dump paged `/search/car/active?dealer_id=` — which returns a `num_found` COUNT but NO `listings` under our entitlement (same truth as BUG-0002) — AND asked for `rows=100` (→ default 10). So it spent quota and stored nothing; the destructive sweep was correctly blocked (deduped=0 fails the coverage guard), so no wrongful deletion ever occurred.
- **Pattern (P2 + P7):** count ≠ availability (wrong endpoint for the data shape) + producer with no consumer.
- **Resolution:** **owner decided to DELETE the pipeline** (reverses the earlier "keep for auto-desking" note in BUG-0008/P7). Removed `lib/inventoryDump.ts`, `cron/dump-inventory/route.ts`, the stale on-select dump comments, and dropped the unused `inventory` table (migration). Commit: fleetfinder-v2 (see merge).
- **Evidence:** live MarketCheck: `/search/car/active?dealer_id=1018518` → `num_found 616, listings 0`; `/dealerships/inventory?dealer_id=1018518` → `616` with listings (confirms the dump could never have captured data). Post-deploy: `GET https://www.lotcompass.com/api/cron/dump-inventory` → **404** (route gone); `to_regclass('public.inventory')` → **null** (table dropped, migration 0032); `get_advisors(security)` shows no new issue.
- **Status:** Resolved by removal — merged to main, deployed & verified live.

### BUG-0020 — `tracked_dealers` vestige: written on dealer-add, read by nothing
- **Date:** 2026-06-21  **Severity:** Low  **Found by:** agent (follow-up to BUG-0019)
- **Area:** `dealers/selection` POST; `tracked_dealers` table
- **Symptom:** after BUG-0019 removed the dump pipeline, `dealers/selection` still upserted every added dealer into `tracked_dealers`, which now had no reader.
- **Root cause:** the on-select registration write outlived the pipeline it fed.
- **Pattern (P7):** producer with no consumer (the last remaining piece of the deleted pipeline).
- **Fix:** removed the `tracked_dealers` upsert from `dealers/selection`; dropped the `tracked_dealers` table (migration `0033`). Dealer-scoped search reads live from `/dealerships/inventory`; the org's selected dealers live in `dealers` (unaffected). Commit: fleetfinder-v2 (this change).
- **Evidence:** `to_regclass('public.tracked_dealers')` → null; build clean; no remaining code refs (`grep tracked_dealers src` empty).
- **Status:** Fixed & verified.

### BUG-0021 — verify-catalog self-chain re-attempts null models every link (cycle stall)
- **Date:** 2026-06-21  **Severity:** Med  **Found by:** audit/v2-correctness (Pass 1)
- **Area:** `src/app/api/cron/verify-catalog/route.ts` (self-chaining monthly sweep)
- **Symptom:** the verification chain burns each chained link's budget re-checking the same transient-miss models, and can keep chaining up to MAX_LINKS=450 without the cycle ever reaching `unattempted===0`.
- **Root cause:** when `verifyModel(...)` returns `null` (a transient MarketCheck miss), the loop did `continue` (line 65), which SKIPS the `catalog_verify_state` upsert at the end of the loop body. `pending` is recomputed each link as "state.updated_at < cycleStart OR absent", so an unstamped model stays pending and is re-attempted on EVERY subsequent link of the same cycle. The intent (per the line-65 comment) was "retry next CYCLE," but the missing stamp makes it retry next LINK.
- **Pattern:** identical to BUG-0016 (refresh-catalog) — a self-chaining cron must mark every model attempted-even-on-null, or never-finished/never-seen items re-run forever. refresh-catalog was fixed by stamping unconditionally (with a warning comment); verify-catalog reintroduced the bug via `continue`. Hunt every self-chaining cron for an early `continue`/`break` that skips the attempted-marker.
- **Fix:** stamp `catalog_verify_state` for every attempted model regardless of outcome; on a `null` result, keep the model's existing discrepancy report (skip the delete/insert) but STILL mark it attempted so it isn't retried until the next cycle. Commit: fleetfinder-v2 (this branch).
- **Evidence:** code: refresh-catalog/route.ts marks `catalog_sync_state` unconditionally after the try/catch (lines ~104) with an explicit comment about this exact stall; verify-catalog/route.ts:65 `continue` bypasses its line-80 upsert. (FleetFinder has no catalog cron — LotCompass-only.)
- **Status:** Fixed & verified (build-gated). Re-verify on next monthly run that `catalog_verify_state` advances for null models.

### BUG-0022 — Auto.dev fallback sent the raw "AWD/4WD" drivetrain label → 0 results
- **Date:** 2026-06-21  **Severity:** Med  **Found by:** audit/v2-correctness (Pass 1)
- **Area:** `src/app/api/live-search/route.ts` `searchAutoDev()` (the Auto.dev fallback path)
- **Symptom:** during a MarketCheck rate-limit/hard-failure, a search with the "AWD/4WD" drivetrain filter falls back to Auto.dev and returns 0 — the agent sees "no inventory" for a filter that is actually fine, exactly when the primary provider is briefly down.
- **Root cause:** the MarketCheck path maps the UI label via `mcDrivetrain` ("AWD/4WD"→"4WD"), but the Auto.dev path sent `body.drivetrain` RAW to `vehicle.drivetrain`. Auto.dev uses the SAME drivetrain vocabulary as MarketCheck (4WD/FWD/RWD, no "AWD") and HONORS the filter, so the combined UI label "AWD/4WD" matches nothing.
- **Pattern (P1 + #21 Auto.dev parity):** any UI label sent to a provider must equal that provider's real vocabulary; the fallback path must apply the SAME value mappers as the primary. Hunt every Auto.dev param for an unmapped UI label.
- **Fix:** apply `mcDrivetrain(body.drivetrain)` on the Auto.dev path (same as MarketCheck). `body_type` is left RAW on Auto.dev deliberately — verified live that Auto.dev's bodyStyle accepts "Truck"/"Van" natively (returns results), whereas MarketCheck's "Cargo Van" returns 0 on Auto.dev, so the MarketCheck mapper must NOT be applied there. Commit: fleetfinder-v2 (this branch). Mirror: FleetFinder `live_search` has the same Auto.dev fallback — apply there too.
- **Evidence (live Auto.dev with our key):** `vehicle.drivetrain=AWD/4WD` → 0 listings; `vehicle.drivetrain=4WD` → 5. `vehicle.bodyStyle=Cargo Van` → 0 but `=Truck` → 5 and `=Van` → 5 (so body_type stays raw). `vehicle.drivetrain=FWD/RWD` already valid raw.
- **Status:** Fixed & verified (live Auto.dev probe + build-gate).

### BUG-0023 — decode-vin uses a memory-only cache → cold-start re-charge + double-decode
- **Date:** 2026-06-21  **Severity:** Med (cost)  **Found by:** audit/v2-correctness (Pass 2)
- **Area:** `src/app/api/decode-vin/route.ts`
- **Symptom:** viewing a VIN's build sheet re-charges the $0.08 NeoVIN decode on every serverless cold start, and a VIN that is BOTH viewed (build sheet) and searched-with-options is decoded twice — two separate $0.08 charges for the same `/decode/car/neovin/{vin}/specs` call.
- **Root cause:** decode-vin calls MarketCheck directly (line 88-90) and caches the result only in `memoryCache` (key `vin::VIN`, in-isolate only). It does NOT use the durable `vin_decode_cache` DB layer that BUG-0006 added to `neovinSpecs`. Worse, the two paths store DIFFERENT parsed payloads (decode-vin's full build sheet vs `neovinSpecs`' `NeovinParsed` slice under key `vinspecs::VIN`), so neither memory nor DB cache is shared — the same upstream decode is paid for twice.
- **Pattern (P4):** in-memory cache doesn't survive serverless cold starts; same class as BUG-0006 (the $2,177 bill driver). Lower volume here (build-sheet view is a deliberate click, not bulk search), so Med not Critical.
- **Fix (APPLIED — owner sign-off given):** added a `build_sheet jsonb` column to the existing per-VIN `vin_decode_cache` row (migration `0034`). New `decodeVinBuildSheet()` in `lib/marketcheck.ts` caches the full build sheet durably (memory → DB `build_sheet` → live) and, on a live decode, ALSO primes the search slice (`payload`) from the SAME raw response via `primeVinDecodeCache()` — so a VIN that's viewed then option-searched is decoded once. `decode-vin/route.ts` now just calls `decodeVinBuildSheet`. `neovinSpecs` (the proven BUG-0006 path) is untouched except a pure extraction of `parseNeovinParsed`. Residual: a VIN option-searched THEN viewed costs one extra decode (search fetches the same raw but only persists the option slice) — bounded ≤1, acceptable. Commit: fleetfinder-v2 (this branch). LotCompass-only (FleetFinder VIN decode uses Base44 storage, not this table).
- **Evidence:** migration `0034` applied (`alter table vin_decode_cache add column build_sheet jsonb` → success); `get_advisors(security)` shows NO new issue (vin_decode_cache already carried the by-design service-role-only `rls_enabled_no_policy` INFO). Build passes. Pre-fix: decode-vin used only `cacheGet/cacheSet` (memory) → cold-start re-charge; post-fix it reads/writes the durable row.
- **Status:** Fixed & verified LIVE (merged to main, deployed). Live re-verify on www.lotcompass.com (authed owner): VIN `2T36DRBV3TW019251` → call 1 `provider:"marketcheck-neovin"` (3 packages, 5 options, 508ms), call 2 `provider:"cache"` (172ms). DB row after: `has_build_sheet=true AND has_payload=true` from the ONE decode (durable build-sheet cache + search-slice prime both confirmed), provider `marketcheck-neovin`, fresh. Migration 0034 `build_sheet` column confirmed present.

### BUG-0024 — Color picker DB-vs-live cleaning divergence (display-only)
- **Date:** 2026-06-21  **Severity:** Low (cosmetic)  **Found by:** audit/v2-correctness (Pass 2)
- **Area:** `list-colors/route.ts`, `list-interior-colors/route.ts` vs `catalogSnapshot.ts` (`cleanColorFacet`)
- **Symptom:** for a model NOT yet in the nightly snapshot (the live fallback), the color picker shows differently-cleaned/deduped names than the DB-served picker for a snapshotted model — e.g. a leading factory code ("0475 Black Sapphire Metallic") is scrubbed in the DB list but shown raw in the live exterior list; conversely the live INTERIOR list strips material qualifiers ("… Leather"/"… Interior") that the DB interior list keeps.
- **Root cause:** two divergent code paths. The snapshot uses `cleanColorFacet` (exterior-tuned: `scrubColorCode` + placeholder-drop + strips metallic/pearl finishes) for BOTH exterior and interior. The live routes hand-roll their own bucketing: list-colors uses `normalizeColorName` only (NO `scrubColorCode`/placeholder-drop), and list-interior-colors uses interior-aware cleaning (strips " interior" suffix + leather/cloth/vinyl/etc.) that `cleanColorFacet` lacks. So exterior diverges one way (live less-clean) and interior the other (live more-clean).
- **Impact:** DISPLAY ONLY. Both paths preserve the RAW facet values in `variants`, and search filters on `variants` (verified live: facet string round-trips exactly), so filtering/counts are correct in both — only the shown name/bucketing differs, and only on the rarely-hit live fallback.
- **Pattern:** DB-first vs live-fallback parity (#2 in the connection map) + duplicated cleaning logic. Hunt: any picker that has separate snapshot-write cleaning and live-read cleaning.
- **Fix (APPLIED — owner sign-off given):** made `cleanColorFacet(items, mode)` mode-aware — `"interior"` strips trim-material qualifiers (leather/leatherette/cloth/vinyl/premium/perforated/suede/alcantara) + a trailing " Interior"; `"exterior"` strips finishes (metallic/pearl/clear-coat) as before. Now used by BOTH `catalogSnapshot.ts` (ext/int + per-trim) AND both live picker routes, so DB-served and live-fallback lists are identical by construction. `variants` (raw) preserved → filtering unaffected. Commit: fleetfinder-v2 (this branch). LotCompass-only (FleetFinder has no nightly snapshot, so its pickers are live-only with no DB to diverge from).
- **Evidence:** `list-colors/route.ts` and `list-interior-colors/route.ts` now call `cleanColorFacet(facet, "exterior"|"interior")` (hand-rolled bucketing removed); `catalogSnapshot.ts:45-46,92` pass the matching mode. Build passes. Filtering still proven by the live round-trip (Storm Cloud facet 5614 → search 5614 — variants unchanged).
- **Status:** Fixed & verified LIVE (merged to main, deployed). Live re-verify on www.lotcompass.com (authed, `fresh:true` to exercise the LIVE cleaner): `list-colors` RAV4 → clean names (Beige, Black, Black Currant Metallic, Blizzard Pearl…) each with raw `variants` preserved; `list-interior-colors` → clean names with merged variants (Ash Softex nv:2, Black nv:4). Both routes now run the shared `cleanColorFacet`, so DB-served and live lists are identical. (Minor pre-existing cosmetic note, NOT a regression: the interior material list doesn't include Toyota "Fabric"/"Softex", so "Ash Fabric" shows separate from "Ash" — same as before this fix; filtering unaffected. Phase-2 nicety.)
